### IPSN Community of Practice on specialized surveillance for emergency response

The [IPSN](https://www.who.int/initiatives/international-pathogen-surveillance-network) was formally launch on 20 May 2023 ahead of the World Health Assembly as a global network of pathogen genomic actors, hosted by the WHO Hub for Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence, to accelerate progress on the deployment of pathogen genomics and improve public health decision-making in line with the implementation of the Global Genomic Strategy for Pathogens with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential. It brings together experts worldwide at the cutting-edge of genomics and data analytics, from governments, philanthropic foundations, multilateral organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector. All share a common goal – to detect and respond to disease threats before they become epidemics and pandemics, and to optimize routine disease surveillance. 

Considering WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has determined that the upsurge of mpox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and a growing number of countries in Africa constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR), IPSN hosted by the WHO Hub is standing-up a Community of Practice for Emergency Response focusing on Mpox to support coordination of pathogen genomics actors.  This will be operational by end of the week of 19 August 2024. 

Community of Practice Objective & Structure 

Objective 

The objective of this CoP is to support members to exchange knowledge that enhances their ability to make informed decisions, solve challenges, and identify new opportunities for utilizing pathogen genomics and wastewater surveillance in the emergency response to Mpox. This is a member-driven forum where priorities are set, content is created and executed collaboratively by members with facilitation support by WHO. 

Working Groups & Workstreams 

The CoP is divided into two working groups: Pathogen Genomics (PGS) and Wastewater Surveillance (WES). Within each work group, there are distinct workstreams which enable members to focus on specific issues most salient to them.  

Workstreams are not meant to be comprehensive of all Mpox related needs: this is an emergency response, and the work should reflect what members need as part of that; nor is the focus solely on the creation products/protocols/goods, though that may be a desired outcome by members.  

Member Engagement 

WHO Facilitation  

Each workstream is facilitated by Chair and Co-Chair, made up of a WHO lead and an expert external to the organization. Together, they will be responsible for liaising with members, communicating logistics and facilitating workstream progress through meetings and discussion forums. 

Collaboratory Platform 

Working group members are invited to the WHO Collaboratory – a platform for real-time discussion and information sharing. Within the Collaboratory, workstreams have been established and members are encouraged to bring questions; share latest documentation and publications. 

Pathogen Genomics Working group  

The IPSN members and partners at the working group will:  

- Support harmonization and in-country deployment of the bioinformatics analysis of MPXV genome data to strengthen quality of the analysis (for example generation of high quality consensus sequences and an External Quality Assurance (EQA) for bioinformatics). 
    

- Build consensus on sequencing standards for genomic data and linked metadata to be uploaded to GISAID and other pathogen genomic data sharing platforms 
    

- Identify mechanisms to promote and facilitate sharing of raw sequencing data 
    

- Support analysis and interpretation of Mpox sequencing data to characterize and monitor changes in disease transmission including identifying new clades, identification/verification of mutations of interest, and monitoring transmission chains.  
    

- Support the integration of sequence data into epidemiological and contextual information as reported by countries. 
    

- IPSN Secretariat is facilitating coordination between donors to genomic surveillance 
    

- The Hub’s Collaboratory platform will host discussions and communication among members for continued dialogue and exchange of expertise in pathogen genomics 
    

Two work streams have been defined for PGS: 

PGS – Data and Benefits sharing 

This work stream will focus on: 

- Identify appropriate mechanisms for timely Mpox genomic data sharing (consensus genomes and raw sequences) 
    

- Identify mechanisms to avoid data fragmentation 
    

- Identify strategies for selection of samples for sequencing 
    

PGS – Better Tools and Standards 

This workstream will focus on: 

- Identifying preferred wet lab and bioinformatic workflows 
    

- Harmonizing data standards and protocols 
    

 Wastewater Surveillance Working Group 

Overview 

Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting and quantifying the monkeypox virus. The virus is excreted in urine and stool at high levels, and its stability in the environment makes it well-suited for monitoring through sewage. Research has shown that wastewater surveillance for monkeypox virus is highly sensitive, capable of detecting viral DNA even when there are just a few confirmed cases . This method's flexibility allows it to be tailored to meet varying public health needs, capacity, and resources. PCR-based techniques can be used to identify the virus and measure viral load, while genomic sequencing enables the monitoring of viral evolution and differentiation between species. 

Workstreams 

The Wastewater Surveillance Working Group aims to support members in increasing their capacity to make decisions about how and if wastewater surveillance can increase situational awareness as part of the Mpox response.  

The Wastewater Surveillance Working Group  To achieve this goal, three workstreams have been defined: 

1. Technical Methods & Approaches 
    

- This workstream is dedicated to discussions around the technical methods and approaches used in wastewater surveillance for Mpox. Topics may include:  
    

- Technique Evaluation: Discuss and assess different analytic methods and their role in rapid deployment of wastewater surveillance for Mpox detection.  
    

- Contextual Adaptation: Share experiences on how different techniques perform under varying conditions, including differences in sanitation systems and outbreak scales. 
    

- Standard Operating Procedures: Review and compare existing guidelines and recommendations for wastewater surveillance across various institutions to identify inconsistencies and gaps.  
    

2. Data Interpretation, Integration, and Communication 
    

- This workstream is focused on the various methodologies and practices for interpreting, integrating, and communicating data related to Mpox. Topics may include: 
    

- Interpreting Findings: Discuss approaches for distinguishing meaningful patterns from Mpox data from wastewater; and the implication for insights into the situation.  
    

- Data Integration and Consistency: Explore challenges and solutions related to integrating clinical and genomic datasets with wastewater data. 
    

- Effective Communication with Stakeholders: Consider strategies for tailoring communication to different stakeholders to ensure the relevance and impact of shared information. 
    

3. Sampling Protocols  
    

- This workstream focuses on discussing approaches for wastewater sampling and understanding how the methodologies used can influence the interpretation of the data. Topics may include: 
    

- Assessment of Sampling Protocols: Explore the effectiveness of sampling protocols in various settings, including healthcare facilities and community environments. 
    

- Adaptation of Sampling Techniques: Discuss how sampling methods can be adapted based on resource availability and local conditions. 
    

- Evaluation of Sampling Method Performance: Evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of different sampling techniques for detecting mpox in wastewater. 
    

will: 

- Evaluate the feasibility of wastewater surveillance for global monitoring of Mpox in an outbreak context. 
    

- Conduct capacity assessments to identify countries with the infrastructure and capability to quickly implement wastewater surveillance. 
    

- Develop technical guidance for rapid response deploying wastewater surveillance strategies in high-risk areas. 
    

- Assist in the analysis and interpretation of wastewater surveillance data in conjunction with clinical data. 
    

- Facilitate the design of primers from genomic data available to ensure the rapid adoption of wastewater surveillance in low-resource settings with different virus epidemiological situation. 
    

- Advocate for standardized data protocols and efficient sharing mechanisms to integrate wastewater surveillance data with clinical datasets. 
    

- Define specific thresholds for initiating public health interventions based on wastewater surveillance data and associated findings.
